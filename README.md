## Introduction
In this repository, I will be leveraging SQL for data analysis tasks and Power BI for visualization. SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to query, manipulate, and analyze data stored in relational databases. We'll utilize SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze data from the database.

Power BI is a powerful business analytics tool by Microsoft that allows users to visualize and share insights from their data. We'll use Power BI to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards that showcase the insights derived from SQL analysis.

## Features
- **Data Analysis with SQL**: Utilize SQL queries to perform data analysis tasks such as filtering, aggregating, and joining datasets.

- **Visualization Report Dashboard**: Create an interactive dashboard using Power BI to visualize key metrics, trends, and insights extracted from the data.

- **Customizable Dashboard**: The Power BI dashboard will be customizable, allowing users to explore different aspects of the data based on their preferences.

## Projects
1. **Pizza Sales**: The Pizza Sales Dashboard Project aims to analyze pizza sales data using SQL queries and visualize the insights through an interactive dashboard created with Power BI. This project offers a holistic approach to grasp and showcase pizza sales trends, customer preferences, and revenue metrics effectively. --->[Go to Project..](https://github.com/Frances-Odunaiya/Data-Analysis-and-Visualizations-Using-SQL-POWERBI/blob/main/Pizza%20Sales/README.md)

## Installation
To use this project, follow these steps:


### Clone this repository:

- Git clone https://github.com/Frances-Odunaiya/Data-Analysis-and-Visualizations-Using-SQL-POWERBI.git

- Ensure you have access to a SQL database management system (DBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.

- Load your dataset into the SQL database or use an existing dataset.

## Usage
- Perform data analysis tasks using SQL queries. Execute these queries in your SQL database management system to extract insights from the dataset.

- Design and execute SQL queries to prepare data for visualization. These queries will fetch the necessary data for visualization in Power BI.

- Use Power BI Desktop to create the visualization report dashboard. Connect Power BI to your SQL database and import the data. Then, design the dashboard by adding visualizations such as charts, graphs, and tables.

- Customize the dashboard layout, design, and interactions to effectively communicate the insights derived from the data analysis.
